Instructions to run the file:

################## PyCharm IDE preferred #############

1. Extract the "proj2_group11_python.zip" to any desired folder.

2. Open the command prompt or terminal on Mac or Linux.

3. Make sure "pygame" library is installed on your machine.

6. Execute the files "Dijkstra_point.py" and "Dijkstra_rigid.py" using the command "python .\<filename>.py"

7. Enter the desired start and end coordinates for the robot according to the bottom left origin (standard) convention for "Dijkstra_rigid.py".

8. Enter the robot size and clearance for "Dijkstra_rigid.py", for "Dijkstra_point.py".

9. Enter the desired start and end coordinates for the robot according to the bottom left origin (standard) convention for "Dijkstra_point.py".

10. The size and clearance values are zero by default for "Dijkstra_point.py".

11. A window will popup animating the algorithm as well as the backtracking.

12. The algorithm traversal is represented using yellow color whereas the start node is represented by blue color and goal node is represented as green color.

13. Each obstacles are represented using red color respectively.
